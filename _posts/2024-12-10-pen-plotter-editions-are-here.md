# Pen Plotter Editions Are Here
December 10, 2024

For a long time, my pen plotter pieces existed only as originals—one drawing, one unique moment. But I wanted to share them with more people while keeping the essence of the work.

So, I’ve started releasinglimited edition prints.

How They’re Made

Each print starts with ahigh-resolution scanof the original plotted piece, keeping every detail intact—the crisp lines, the ink textures, even the small irregularities that make plotted art what it is.

They’re printed onEpson Semi Gloss paper, which has abright white toneand anextra smooth texture. This keeps the fine details sharp while adding a slight sheen that works well with the deep contrasts of my work. Each edition issigned and numbered.

More Sizes, Now with Framing Options

Unlike my original plotted pieces, these editions come inthree sizes:

A3 (11.7 × 16.5 inches / 29.7 × 42 cm)
A2 (16.5 × 23.4 inches / 42 × 59.4 cm)
A1 (23.4 × 33.1 inches / 59.4 × 84.1 cm)

And for the first time,framing is available. If you want the piece ready to hang, you can choose a framed version directly from the shop.

What’s Available Now?

There are alreadynine editions live in the shop, with more to come.I selected my preferred pieces—some reveal new details at a larger scale, others keep the same intensity as the original. And yes, that includesSynapses, the piece that’s going to the Grand Palais this year.
