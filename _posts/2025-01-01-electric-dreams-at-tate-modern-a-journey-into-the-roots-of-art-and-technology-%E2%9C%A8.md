# Electric Dreams at Tate Modern Visit ✨
January 1, 2025

Last week, I visitedElectric Dreamsat Tate Modern in London. For someone into generative art and pen plotters, this show was like stepping back to the beginnings of art made with technology. 🌐

The exhibition celebrates the pioneers who turned new tools into creative mediums before computers were everywhere. From pen plotter works to video installations and light sculptures, it’s all about experimenting with technology as an art form. 🔹

### Highlights of the Exhibition 🎨

#### Mary Martin –Permutation of Six(1966)

One of the pieces that stood out for me wasPermutation of Sixby Mary Martin. Made without a computer, it uses a Truchet tiling algorithm to create geometric patterns. Since I’ve spent years exploring this technique myself, this piece really hit home. It’s a timeless idea that I plan to keep working on for years. ♥️

#### Katsuhiro Yamaguchi –Fujitsubo (Barnacle)(1966/2017)

This light sculpture mixes form and light in such a clever way. It looks like a 3D light drawing—both a sculpture and something more dynamic. I loved how it blurred the lines between physical and visual art. 💡

#### Edward Zajec –RAM 2 V.3(1969)

This pen plotter piece, made with an IBM 1620 and ComPlot DP-1, has a great architectural feel. The dark areas create a 3D effect that’s both abstract and structured. It’s amazing to see how artists back then pushed these machines to make something so fresh. 🏰

#### Nake –Matrizmultiplikation Serie 29(1967)

This colorful pen plotter artwork is based on matrix multiplication algorithms. The bold colors and layered grids are so inspiring. Working with vibrant palettes is something I enjoy, and this piece gave me new ideas. 🖌️

#### Katsuhiro Yamaguchi – Corrugated Glass Video Installation

This piece uses corrugated glass to turn video into something like pixel art. I loved how it made me imagine what the original footage might have been. It’s such a simple but effective way to challenge how we see things. 🔣

#### Charles Csuri – Pen Plot Portrait (1967)

This portrait, made with a NASA computer and pen plotter, really got to me. My own pen plotter journey started with portraits, so this piece felt personal. It’s incredible to see where it all began. 🌟

### Why You Should Visit 📍

Electric Dreamsisn’t just an exhibition—it’s a look at the early days of turning tech into art. It shows how, even with limited tools, artists found ways to make something beautiful. If you’re into generative art, pen plotting, or the history of art and technology, you shouldn’t miss it. 📚

The show runs until June 1, 2025. You can check it out at Tate Modern—more infohere.
