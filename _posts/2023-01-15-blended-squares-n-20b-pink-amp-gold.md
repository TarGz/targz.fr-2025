# Blended Squares n°20b Pink Gold
January 15, 2023

2023 - 59 x 84cm - Bristol Paper & Acrylic

I really wanted to mix pink and gold acrylic, but it turned out to be trickier than I expected. The inks wouldn’t overlap the way I wanted—they kept blending unpredictably. After a lot of trial and error, I finally got this one I loved.
