A 'Lego' brick font I end up desinging 

I was working for a while on this idea of creating a alphabet of "Lego" bricks and after [different attempt](https://targz.github.io/leisure/playing-with-3D-printable-lego-typeface/) and a lot of experiments I finaly focused on making a monospaced font, to be align with what Lego bricks are I decided to work on a mono spaced font and try to make the letters as small as possible and finally I use 3x5 lego unit for each letters and 1 unit as space.

This 3x5 lego unit bring a lot of constrain so it was really challenging to find a desing that meet the monospace requirement and get this "lego look" I was seeking for.
