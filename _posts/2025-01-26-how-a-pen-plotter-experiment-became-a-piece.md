# How a Pen Plotter Experiment Became a Piece
January 26, 2025

What started as a simple experiment to see how far an Ecoline pen could last turned into something unexpected. I set up a file with 300 meters of parallel lines and let the plotter do its thing. The Magenta pen didn’t stop working—it just faded beautifully, creating a soft gradient. That moment sparked an idea: I ran a Cyan pen horizontally, blending into the fading strokes, and suddenly, what began as a test became a striking piece of art.

This experience was a great reminder that some of my favorite works actually started as happy accidents or simple experiments. It’s funny how, especially with pen plotters, the most interesting results often come from just playing around with an idea and seeing where it takes you.
