# A Plot in the Wild
May 25-31, 2025

**Global Video Art Exhibition**  
25 cities across 7 countries


Part of Project / Forward: 2049, this global video art exhibition takes art out of galleries and into public spaces. The project features artists from Australia, Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Norway, Spain, and the United States.
"What I love most about this project is that it takes art out of galleries and brings it directly to people in their everyday environments."
The exhibition transforms urban landscapes into open-air galleries, making art accessible to everyone regardless of their proximity to traditional art institutions.
