# The Bitcoin Genesis Exhibition
October 10, 2022


Exhibition featuring the Bitcoin Genesis artwork, exploring the intersection of cryptocurrency and generative art. This piece visualizes the genesis block of Bitcoin through algorithmic patterns, creating a physical manifestation of digital currency's foundational moment.

The work bridges the gap between the intangible nature of blockchain technology and the tactile experience of pen-plotted art, offering viewers a unique perspective on the aesthetics of decentralized systems.
