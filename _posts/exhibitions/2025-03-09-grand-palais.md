Bringing generative, pen-plotted art to the Grand Palais felt both surreal and deeply meaningful. This iconic Parisian venue, with its magnificent glass roof and Beaux-Arts architecture, provided a stunning backdrop for contemporary computational art. The exhibition explores the intersection of historical Constructivist principles with modern generative techniques, showcasing how algorithmic processes can create works that resonate with the geometric abstraction and systematic approaches of the early 20th century avant-garde.

## A Space Steeped in History

Walking through the Grand Palais, I couldn't help but feel the weight of its history. Originally built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition, this architectural masterpiece has been home to a vast array of events from scientific fairs to major cultural exhibitions. Over the decades, it has also welcomed generations of artists, each leaving their mark and pushing the boundaries of what art can be. To be part of this legacy, even in my own small way, was humbling.

## Finding My Place Among Masters

One of the highlights of this experience was the incredible artists I had the chance to meet. JARA, the leader of our Constructivism group, welcomed me with open arms and made me feel like I truly belonged. His generosity and leadership set the tone for a space where ideas flowed freely, and artistic boundaries were stretched.

## Conversations That Left a Mark

Another defining moment came from my discussions with Rebecca Chou. Her keen eye and constructive feedback challenged me to think differently about my work. It’s not often you find someone who understands your approach yet pushes you to refine it further. Those conversations, along with exchanges with other artists, were some of the most enriching moments of the entire exhibition.

## The Beauty of the Grand Palais

Beyond the people, the setting itself was breathtaking. Seeing my plotted lines displayed under the massive glass dome, within a space that has hosted some of the greatest exhibitions, added another layer of meaning to my work. It was a reminder that art, no matter how it’s created, has a place in history when it challenges perceptions and sparks conversations.

## Looking Ahead

This exhibition was more than just a show it was a validation of the medium I’ve chosen to explore. Generative art, pen plotting, and algorithmic design have a voice in contemporary art, even in the most traditional settings. I left the Grand Palais not just with memories, but with a renewed drive to push my practice even further.
