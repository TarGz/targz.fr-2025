A commissioned work exploring maze-like patterns and algorithmic structures. This exhibition presents intricate labyrinths generated through code, where each path represents a possible solution in a complex system.
The piece invites viewers to lose themselves in the geometric complexity while contemplating the relationship between human perception and computational logic.
