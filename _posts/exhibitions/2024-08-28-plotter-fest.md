A meetup organized by Bantam Tools where every pen plotter artist came with a piece turned out to be a great chance to share my work and connect with others. It wasn’t just about showing art, it was about the community. The conversations pushed me to try new materials and formats, and thanks to Nima Nabavi’s encouragement, I experimented with canvas for the first time. It felt less like a festival and more like a lab, buzzing with energy, ideas, and passionate people.
